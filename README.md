# Translation Using LSTM-Based Encoder-Decoder Model

Introduction

This project aims to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and an Encoder-Decoder architecture for translating English sentences into Tamil. The model leverages sequence-to-sequence learning to handle word order differences and syntactic variations between the two languages.

Features

-->  Implements LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder architecture.

-->  Uses Tokenization & Embeddings for better word representation.

-->  Trained on an English-Tamil parallel corpus.

-->  Utilizes Beam Search for improved translation quality.

-->  Supports attention mechanism for better contextual understanding.
